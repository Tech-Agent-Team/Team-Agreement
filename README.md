* WE have to make sure each member understands his part of work so the project will be clear for everyone
  
* for any unresolved conflict or issue we can contact with the instructional team

## Communication Plan

* We are planning to meet each day in the morning, Assign each member with a specific task and merge our branches at the end of the day at a specific time to be agreed on.

* We created a slack group to communicate , also using discord and zoom

 ## Work Plan

 * we are planning to divide each days work into multiple tasks according to how difficult the task is, if the task is more difficult than others, multiple team members will be assigned with task.

 * we will use trello to manage tasks 

 ## Git Process

for Backend:
* we are going to work as a team  on the backend as navigators and drivers so that we limit the probability of conflicts.
 
 For frotend:
 * all project files will be in our github organization project repo, we will create a branch with a version of the code each day, we will push our work for each day to the organization's repo and merge feature branches with each day's branch(version)

 ```
 steps:

1- git checkout -b <version> (from the latest version)
2- git checkout -b <feature> from main branch (which is empty to avoid conflict)
3- git pull origin (latest version)
4- push and merge with the current day branch
5- and finally repeat the process each day

```
* merging will be done by merging each feature branch with current version
* any difficulties will be dealt with by assitance from team members
